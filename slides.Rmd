# Find your own voice

* I'm no writing coach but I'd say, be sincere.

* What language? English or your own? Or two of them like Daniela Vasquez https://d4tagirl.com/

# Store your ideas

* Your usual note taking workflow: notebook, fancy app (Trello?), etc.

* I have a notebook and used to have an empty GitHub repo with ideas as issues.
